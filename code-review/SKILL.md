name: code-review
description: Review either current WIP or committed changes from a fixed point along two axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".
---

Review either the current WIP or the committed-tree diff from a fixed point:

- **WIP** — include staged and unstaged tracked changes in the working tree.
- **Fixed-point committed tree** — review only committed changes from the requested fixed point.

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing.

## Process

### 1. Select the baseline and exact diff rule

Choose one mode; never silently mix them:

- **WIP mode** — when the user asks for WIP, worktree, staged, unstaged, or current uncommitted changes. If a fixed point is supplied, the target is the union of `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (committed changes from the merge-base) and `git diff HEAD` (the combined staged and unstaged tracked changes against `HEAD`). If no fixed point is supplied, the target is `git diff HEAD` with `HEAD` as the baseline. Treat the two patches as one review target; do not replace `git diff HEAD` with `git diff` or `git diff --cached`.
- **Fixed-point committed-tree mode** — when the user requests a committed branch/tree review without WIP. Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. The baseline is the merge-base and the exact diff is `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot). Also note the commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

If neither mode nor a fixed point is clear, ask the user. Record the selected baseline and exact diff rule verbatim; this same rule must be passed to both sub-agents in step 4.

Before going further, confirm every supplied fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and that the selected diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The exact baseline and diff rule selected in step 1, verbatim. In WIP mode, explicitly identify both `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (when a fixed point was supplied) and `git diff HEAD`; in committed-tree mode, explicitly identify `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` and its merge-base baseline.
- The commit list when the selected rule includes one.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3 pasted in full** — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The exact baseline and diff rule selected in step 1, verbatim. Review exactly that target, including staged and unstaged tracked changes in WIP mode and excluding them in committed-tree mode.
- The commit list when the selected rule includes one.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."


If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes — that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
